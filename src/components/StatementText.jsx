          Hi, I'm Jason and I'm eager to gain some commercial experience in the
          field of web design and web development within either a front-end or
          back-end development role. Over the past 18 months I've been learning
          both front and back-end development through my own project work, which
          has included building an online customer management system with PHP,
          MySQL and Google Maps API integration along with deploying it to a
          live hosting environment. I've also built numerous JavaScript games,
          and more recently I've been getting to grips with React Native. I'm
          available for interview at short notice and would be able to start a
          new role within three weeks.{' '}
